<strong>Jido</strong>

Jido is a Java-based programming language with a focus on minimal syntax and flexibility in defining and manipulating variables. While still in development, Jido currently supports variables, essential control flow features (if, for, while, break, return, etc.), recursion, and an upgraded C-style ternary operator :)

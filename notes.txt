Maximal munch - in the scanner class, more specifically the switch cases for tokens, we do not implement it as 

case 'o':
  if (match('r')) {
    addToken(OR);
  }
  break;

because the scanner could potentially emit an or keyword token immediately, even if it was part of a variable (e.g. var named orchid). Instead, we assume any lexeme stating with a letter or underscore is an identifier until further notice.

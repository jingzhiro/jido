Maximal munch - in the scanner class, more specifically the switch cases for tokens, we do not implement it as 

case 'o':
  if (match('r')) {
    addToken(OR);
  }
  break;

because the scanner could potentially emit an or keyword token immediately, even if it was part of a variable (e.g. var named orchid). Instead, we assume any lexeme stating with a letter or underscore is an identifier until further notice.

GRAMMAR
expression     → equality ;
equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term           → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor         → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
               | "(" expression ")" ;

By using different environments when we execute the body, calls to the same function with the same code can produce different results.
